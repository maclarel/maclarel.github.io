      <description>I use Arch, btw I&amp;rsquo;ve been using Linux for ages, nearly two decades at this point. I actually dug out my old Mandrake and Slackware CDs while going through a box in my basement the other day&amp;hellip; quite the flashback.
Despite that tenure on at least some of the hardware I&amp;rsquo;ve owned at any given time, I&amp;rsquo;ve never really used it as a daily driver for desktop usage. That changed today when I finally sat down and set up Arch, complete with forgetting to install a boot loader, on my main rig.</description>

      <description>What did I do? Half fueled by beer, and half by a playlist of keygen tracks, I decided that it would be a good idea to finally getting around to rebuilding my long-lived server&amp;hellip; No more Windows and its infuriating forced updates (which you used to be able to override), lack of clear/consistent OS level event scripting for integration with my UPS, or garbage-tier support from Docker. I wanted something that I&amp;rsquo;d finally have the level of control I wanted for something that backs pretty much eveverything I use outside of work.</description>

      <description>Keebs Mechanical keyboards, sometimes calld keebs, come up from time to time as a bit of a meme. &amp;ldquo;Oh, you&amp;rsquo;ve got one of those loud keyboards.&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;Why on earth did you spend $500 ona a keyboard that does the same thing as the $5 one I got from Office Depot?&amp;rdquo;.
I&amp;rsquo;ll say that, for the really cheap end of the spectrum with mechanical keyboards, this really is a meme that holds up.</description>

      <title>Hello via GitHub Pages</title>

      <description>Well this is new&amp;hellip; Rather than dealing with Blogger, a dubious mobile interface, and spreading things across many services&amp;hellip; why not just use GitHub Pages? I&amp;rsquo;m so used to writing markdown at this point that it just seems easier ðŸ˜„
Hugo Inspired by tmpdubz I figured I&amp;rsquo;d do a double-whammy here - play around with/learn GitHub Pages, while also giving my blog a much needed cosmetic overhaul/simplification/rebranding. This lead to Hugo, which is pretty darn neat.</description>

      <title>SSH Port Forwarding</title>
      <link>https://maclarel.github.io/posts/2020-07/ssh-port-forwarding/</link>

      <guid>https://maclarel.github.io/posts/2020-07/ssh-port-forwarding/</guid>
      <description>Have a service that you don&amp;rsquo;t want to directly expose, or that doesn&amp;rsquo;t have good security, that you still need to access? Today we&amp;rsquo;re going to look at using SSH to accomplish this!
This tutorial uses nc, UFW/IPTables, and SSH to demonstrate how to forward any port over an SSH connection on TCP 22. You can extend this to just about any service. For example, this works for accessing websites, or other services that are exposed through a web browser.</description>

      <description>Following up from my &amp;ldquo;Starting out with a home lab&amp;rdquo; article I&amp;rsquo;ve made some pretty nice updates to my home lab setup, and I&amp;rsquo;ve also got my {Ansible playbooks](https://github.com/maclarel/ansible_playbooks) up on GitHub now!
Starting out with the lab additions:
 Gigabit internet (Cable, unfortunately) recently became available here, so I&amp;rsquo;ve now got a 1000/30 connection! Upload speeds are depressing, but still 3x the speed I had previously! UniFi Dream Machine has taken over my network.</description>
