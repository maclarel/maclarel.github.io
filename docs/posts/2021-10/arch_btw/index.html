<p>I&rsquo;ve been using Linux for ages, nearly two decades at this point. I actually dug out my old Mandrake and Slackware CDs while going through a box in my basement the other day&hellip; quite the flashback.</p>
<p>Despite that tenure on at least some of the hardware I&rsquo;ve owned at any given time, I&rsquo;ve never really used it as a daily driver for <em>desktop</em> usage. That changed today when I finally sat down and set up Arch, complete with forgetting to install a boot loader, on my main rig.</p>
<p>One catch though&hellip; I did it in Virtual Box.</p>
<h1 id="but-its-in-a-vm">But it&rsquo;s in a VM<a href="#but-its-in-a-vm" class="anchor" aria-hidden="true"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M15 7h3a5 5 0 0 1 5 5 5 5 0 0 1-5 5h-3m-6 0H6a5 5 0 0 1-5-5 5 5 0 0 1 5-5h3"></path><line x1="8" y1="12" x2="16" y2="12"></line></svg></a></h1>
<p>Yeah, yeah, yeah. I know. I&rsquo;d prefer to have it on bare metal as well, however my main passtime outside of tinkering with technology is playing WoW Classic. At first you may think &ldquo;Ok, that definitely runs under Wine/Proton, right?&rdquo; and yes, it does, but Blizzard also has a long history of banning Linux gamers for perceived cheating, &ldquo;using an unsupported operating system&rdquo;, or any other number of non-sensical reasons.</p>
<p>In any case, that has kept me using Windows as the main OS installed on bare metal. Flip side, Virtual Box has come a long way and is exceptionally good for virtualizing a desktop OS - especially when compared to Hyper-V which I was using previously.</p>
<p>All that to say, I&rsquo;ve been working out of i3 on Arch all day despite it running in a VM and the only thing it has made me want to do is quit WoW so I can just use this without any additional overhead. It&rsquo;s wonderful.</p>
<h1 id="how-did-the-setup-go">How did the setup go?<a href="#how-did-the-setup-go" class="anchor" aria-hidden="true"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M15 7h3a5 5 0 0 1 5 5 5 5 0 0 1-5 5h-3m-6 0H6a5 5 0 0 1-5-5 5 5 0 0 1 5-5h3"></path><line x1="8" y1="12" x2="16" y2="12"></line></svg></a></h1>
<p>The Arch Wiki&rsquo;s installation guide is reasonably good, though like all things Arch it expects you to do a fair bit of research for yourself. If you haven&rsquo;t toyed around with Arch before, or at least don&rsquo;t have a very good understanding of how to do things like manually configure a network interface from scratch, I&rsquo;d suggest against doing this for your first time unless you&rsquo;re into learning-by-doing (like I am).</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve dabbled with Gentoo in the past, and this is nowhere near that level of confusing to setup, but it&rsquo;s still not a pretty GUI like you&rsquo;ll get with Ubuntu or Pop, etc&hellip; That said, that didn&rsquo;t really factor into my decision.</p>
<p>I had a few hiccups during installation, mostly due to not quite understanding what I was getting &ldquo;for free&rdquo; with the installation vs what was running on the live disk I used for the installation. This meant that I had to spend a good 30-45 minutes figuring out all of the packages I needed to get my networking functional (I ended up using <code>networkd</code> for the sake of having it in line with my other boxen). Beyond that, though, was an infuriating 90 minute stretch of trying to get i3 to work&hellip;</p>
<p>i3 relies on <code>i3-config-wizard</code> to do the initial configuration file creation to actually be able to start i3, however <em>that wizard requires X to be running despite still being a text interface</em> which is beyond bizarre. It wasn&rsquo;t until I got xmonad running (and realizing that it wasn&rsquo;t for me) that I was able to actually get i3 configured and working. Haven&rsquo;t looked back since. After coming from a lot of tinkering with Amethyst, DisplayFusion, Yabai, and other &ldquo;window managers&rdquo; on Windows and MacOS, having something like i3 and it&rsquo;s integration with Xorg is&hellip; well, mindblowing. Full control over everything. It&rsquo;s perfect.</p>
<p>Without getting into the religious debates of what WM is the best, least bloated, etc&hellip; This is a fantastic example of the type of freedom you can get when you move away from Windows/MacOS and into an ecosystem that&rsquo;s literally built around user choice and flexibility. I&rsquo;ve never been one to enjoy playing within the rules, and now I truly don&rsquo;t have to.</p>
<h1 id="hows-it-going">How&rsquo;s it going?<a href="#hows-it-going" class="anchor" aria-hidden="true"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M15 7h3a5 5 0 0 1 5 5 5 5 0 0 1-5 5h-3m-6 0H6a5 5 0 0 1-5-5 5 5 0 0 1 5-5h3"></path><line x1="8" y1="12" x2="16" y2="12"></line></svg></a></h1>
<p>I&rsquo;ll do another post in a few weeks to recap using Arch + i3 as a daily driver for that period of time, but initial impressions are exclusively positive.</p>
<p>My experience of using Linux as a desktop OS in the past were mostly sullied by my own choices (Slackware as a daily driver? Eep!) or lack of knowledge at the time&hellip; but hey, that&rsquo;s how you learn. With the readily available knowledge between Wikis, colleages, friends, and Reddit it&rsquo;s now somewhat trivial to find answers to questions that would have taken weeks to sort out on IRC or forums (though I still enjoy both).</p>
<p>As an aside, the workspace approach here (and more importantly being able to trivially hotkey windows over to specific workspaces) is a game changer after coming from Windows/MacOS. I know that can all be done through various ways there as well, and I use those approaches, but it&rsquo;s <em>seamless</em> in i3 (and I&rsquo;m sure many other WMs). I love it.</p>
<h1 id="whats-next">What&rsquo;s next?<a href="#whats-next" class="anchor" aria-hidden="true"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M15 7h3a5 5 0 0 1 5 5 5 5 0 0 1-5 5h-3m-6 0H6a5 5 0 0 1-5-5 5 5 0 0 1 5-5h3"></path><line x1="8" y1="12" x2="16" y2="12"></line></svg></a></h1>
<p>Current things for me to tweak/understand:</p>
<ul>
<li>Can I get any GPU passthrough configured for this, and do I even need/want to? Performance is great for any non-gaming, and I can just pop out to Windows for that.</li>
<li>Play around with some more i3 config to get tiling layout just how I want it, and align keybinds with what I&rsquo;m using on my other systems to limit context switching.</li>
<li>Play around with i3 gaps for a sexier layout, though I am loving the completely efficient use of space that i3 is giving me so far.</li>
</ul>
