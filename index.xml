Adorable. The goal, as usual, is to find both user and root flags. This is done through a combination of SSTI and XXE, and admittedly is one of the most difficult challenges that I&amp;rsquo;ve completed so far&amp;hellip; despite being on the &amp;ldquo;easy&amp;rdquo; end of the spectrum.
Notes in this writeup will be a bit more freeform than others as I think sharing the overall approach I took may be of interest.</description></item><item><title>DEFCON 30 - Homecoming</title><link>https://maclarel.github.io/posts/2022-08/defcon30/</link><pubDate>Sat, 20 Aug 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://maclarel.github.io/posts/2022-08/defcon30/</guid><description>At last, DEFCON&amp;hellip; I&amp;rsquo;ve wanted to go to DEFCON since I first heard about it almost 20 years ago, and finally the stars aligned and it was a possibility this year. Spoilers, it didn&amp;rsquo;t disappoint.
While DEFCON is no longer the insane party that you may have heard of in the past, it&amp;rsquo;s none the less three-ish days of discovery and debauchery. Everything from super in-depth talks, to scavenger hunterse, to impromptu analog synth parties in the back end of the venue last at night after most folks have gone to bed.</description></item><item><title>Hack The Box - Phonebook</title><link>https://maclarel.github.io/posts/2022-08/htb_phonebook/</link><pubDate>Mon, 15 Aug 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://maclarel.github.io/posts/2022-08/htb_phonebook/</guid><description>Premise Phonebook is a Web challenge from Hack The Box that presents us with a login page for a &amp;ldquo;phonebook&amp;rdquo; system. The goal here is to find a flag hidden somewhere, however it&amp;rsquo;s considerably less obvious than it may seem.
Exploration When first navigating to the challenge URL you&amp;rsquo;l be greeted with a login prompt to access the phonebook. There don&amp;rsquo;t appear to be any useful links here, however there&amp;rsquo;s a note that the system now supports &amp;ldquo;workstation logins&amp;rdquo; and that post is signed by someone called &amp;ldquo;Reese&amp;rdquo;.</description></item><item><title>Management, burnout, and upcoming changes</title><link>https://maclarel.github.io/posts/2022-06/changes/</link><pubDate>Sun, 19 Jun 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://maclarel.github.io/posts/2022-06/changes/</guid><description>Management I got into management about a year ago, and it has been one hell of a ride. There&amp;rsquo;s sort of a running joke that &amp;ldquo;management isn&amp;rsquo;t for everyone&amp;rdquo;, and I can certainly verify that.
I had moved into management with the hopes of it being a great way to advance my career further, push me closer to the goal of getting a Director position, and hopefully scratching the same problem solving itch that solving technical problems and helping organize my team as a lead did.</description></item><item><title>Ploopy Classic &amp; Nano Trackballs</title><link>https://maclarel.github.io/posts/2022-06/ploopy/</link><pubDate>Sun, 19 Jun 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://maclarel.github.io/posts/2022-06/ploopy/</guid><description>That&amp;rsquo;s a silly name Yes.
What are they? Ploopy is a company that designs and produces open-source trackballs and mice.
Having been a Trackball enthusiast for a while, and not being able to find one that I really liked, I figured I&amp;rsquo;d give this a shot. One of my gripes in general has been that most of the trackballs out there are either great functionall but have shitty ergnomics, or have great ergonomics and awful functionality/drivers.</description></item><item><title>HackTheBox - Cyber Apocalypse 2022</title><link>https://maclarel.github.io/posts/2022-05/htb_cyber_apolcalypse/</link><pubDate>Tue, 24 May 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://maclarel.github.io/posts/2022-05/htb_cyber_apolcalypse/</guid><description>Well, that was harder than expected Many times in life it&amp;rsquo;s great to have a humbling experience. Not that I had an ego in this space anyway, I&amp;rsquo;m super new to it, but I was going in expecting to be able to crank through a fair number of challenges for this event. Let&amp;rsquo;s just say that didn&amp;rsquo;t happen.
Cyber Apocalypse 2022 was a jeopardy style CTF event with categories across all of the usual HackTheBox challenge content.</description></item><item><title>Microsoft Strike CTF 2022 - Contoso Financial</title><link>https://maclarel.github.io/posts/2022-04/msft_contoso_strike/</link><pubDate>Tue, 19 Apr 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://maclarel.github.io/posts/2022-04/msft_contoso_strike/</guid><description>Premise Microsoft runs an internal CTF event every so often called Strike CTF. While we&amp;rsquo;ve been asked not to share specifics around the challenges involved, I wanted to do a brief write-up, as it&amp;rsquo;s certainly a unique one that catered to multiple skill levels and had an educational twist.
For anyone interested in doing some digging, the version Microsoft runs has also been seen in some B-Sides events (and other conferences) under the name ShadowBank.</description></item><item><title>Hack The Box - Pandora</title><link>https://maclarel.github.io/posts/2022-04/htb_pandora/</link><pubDate>Mon, 04 Apr 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://maclarel.github.io/posts/2022-04/htb_pandora/</guid><description>Premise Second verse same as the first - we&amp;rsquo;re given an IP and no further information. Commence enumeration!
Enumeration To set the stage, enumeration is probably the hardest part of this challenge. The rest is doable with some patience and research.
Out of the gate we have a website talking about some random product. There&amp;rsquo;s nothing interactable, and nmap only gives us TCP 22 and 80 as open ports.
Fuzzing with ffuf and nikto turns up nothing actionable, just icons and asset directories, neither of which can be used for anything.</description></item><item><title>Hack The Box - Paper</title><link>https://maclarel.github.io/posts/2022-04/htb_paper/</link><pubDate>Fri, 01 Apr 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://maclarel.github.io/posts/2022-04/htb_paper/</guid><description>Premise As with all Hack The Box (HTB) Machines we&amp;rsquo;re given nothing more than an IP.
Initial target enumeration with nmap shows us TCP 22, 80, and 443 open, with SSH and Apache 2.4.37 respectively. The TLS information returned isn&amp;rsquo;t super helpful, and hitting the website gives us nothing more than the default CentOS Apache httpd page.
Further exploration Next step, after a lot of poking, prodding, fuzzing, etc&amp;hellip; and getting nowhere was to try out nikto to see if there&amp;rsquo;s anything else the webserver might be leaking for us.</description></item><item><title>picoCTF - notepad</title><link>https://maclarel.github.io/posts/2022-03/pico_notepad/</link><pubDate>Sat, 26 Mar 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://maclarel.github.io/posts/2022-03/pico_notepad/</guid><description>Premise We&amp;rsquo;re given a service that will take abitrary input, and render it as an HTML page.
There are a few restrictions:
Content cannot be longer than 512 characters Content cannot include _ or / characters Lastly, from the Dockerfile we know that the flag is going to have an arbtirary name starting with flag-.
Examining the tarball This challenge comes with a tarball that contains the source code so we can do some white box analysis of how all of this works.</description></item></channel></rss>
