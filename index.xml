Like every year prior, I continue to strongly recommend this conference to anyone and everyone in the cybersecurity space. NorthSec (nSec) is somewhat unique, in my experience, in that it caters to nearly all skill levels and strives to make itself as accessible to students (with reduced prices, too!) as to industry veterans.
Beyond the accessibility, for an event with two stages they manage every year to have a huge variety of topics covered.</description></item><item><title>Seeing Red (Team)</title><link>https://www.maclaren.dev/posts/2024-09/seeing_red/</link><pubDate>Tue, 10 Sep 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.maclaren.dev/posts/2024-09/seeing_red/</guid><description>Another change!? Jeez, how often do I change jobs? Seems like a lot, but it really isn&amp;rsquo;t. I&amp;rsquo;m still at the same company, I&amp;rsquo;ve just moved to a different team, and that&amp;rsquo;s after nearly 2 1/2 years in the my last role.
So what am I doing&amp;hellip;?
The best defense is a good offense My jersey has changed colours from blue to red! That&amp;rsquo;s right, I managed to social engineer our Red Team into thinking I&amp;rsquo;m the right person to join their team and enhance their capabilities.</description></item><item><title>DEFCON 32 - Very ENGAGING</title><link>https://www.maclaren.dev/posts/2024-08/defcon32/</link><pubDate>Fri, 16 Aug 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.maclaren.dev/posts/2024-08/defcon32/</guid><description>Another year in ~hell~ Vegas We were back under one roof this year, which was such a nice change. For 30 and 31 I spent more time walking between talks/buildings than I did actually in the conference, to the point that I missed most if not all of the talks I wanted to see at 31. Not this year!
Relevant to work, this year also saw the debut of the Bug Bounty village.</description></item><item><title>NorthSec 2024 (FeetSec 2024?)</title><link>https://www.maclaren.dev/posts/2024-05/nsec_2024/</link><pubDate>Tue, 28 May 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.maclaren.dev/posts/2024-05/nsec_2024/</guid><description>Let&amp;rsquo;s get this out of the way NorthSec has nothing to do with feet, but somehow that became the theme this year thanks due to something getting lost in translation during an event. If you know, you know. If you don&amp;rsquo;t, then I guess you&amp;rsquo;ll have to come to the event in the future and find out!

I wish the NorthSec conference wasn&amp;rsquo;t only two days The amount of outstanding content, workshops, and side quests that NorthSec offers is just too much for only two days.</description></item><item><title>Cooking up some more CVEs</title><link>https://www.maclaren.dev/posts/2024-04/mealie/</link><pubDate>Tue, 09 Apr 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.maclaren.dev/posts/2024-04/mealie/</guid><description>Unlike state secrets, I don&amp;rsquo;t want my brisket recipes to wind up in a Florida bathroom As a follow up to the last time I wrote about CVEs, I&amp;rsquo;ve amassed a few more to my name:

The premise of his article was effectively that in many companies Support is often seen as entry level, with no possible advancement in the organization outside of management. While his proposal discusses laddering up to &amp;ldquo;Senior&amp;rdquo; positions, I find that this may be aiming too low when looking at deeply technical support work like with many &amp;ldquo;enterprise&amp;rdquo; products.</description></item><item><title>State of the Lab (late 2023)</title><link>https://www.maclaren.dev/posts/2023-12/lab_updates/</link><pubDate>Sat, 23 Dec 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.maclaren.dev/posts/2023-12/lab_updates/</guid><description>Didn&amp;rsquo;t you just blog that this was going to be a 2024 project? Or, more specifically, I got a bit too excited after writing the last post and some hardware I was eyeing up went on sale. Since this update is happening today (hopefully) I figured this might be a good time to finally do a full walkthrough of what hardware and services I&amp;rsquo;m running.
The hardware Old &amp;amp; busted As noted, I&amp;rsquo;m finally replacing my venerable home server.</description></item><item><title>2023 in Review - DEFCON, CVEs, and Life</title><link>https://www.maclaren.dev/posts/2023-12/2023/</link><pubDate>Tue, 19 Dec 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.maclaren.dev/posts/2023-12/2023/</guid><description>What is time, anyway? 2023 is at an end, and my posts to this blog have been few and far between this year.

Please enjoy this highlight reel of &amp;ldquo;fun&amp;rdquo; things that 2023 has brought&amp;hellip;
I spoke at a few conferences One of my personal goals this year was to submit to a few CFPs (Call for Papers) for various security-related conferences after getting back into public speaking in some capacity with BSides Ottawa in 2022.</description></item><item><title>NorthSec 2023 - A LAN party for hackers</title><link>https://www.maclaren.dev/posts/2023-05/nsec2023/</link><pubDate>Sat, 20 May 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.maclaren.dev/posts/2023-05/nsec2023/</guid><description>What is NorthSec? NorthSec is a security conference in Montreal, QC, Canada that has been running since 2013. In addition to fantastic technical talks, awesome badges, and free beer (yes, really), they have one of the largest in-person CTF events on earth.
This year&amp;rsquo;s event saw ~1,500 attendees for the conference/talks, and 700+ for the in-person CTF event.
Somewhat unique, at least in my conference experience, much of the content in the talks at North Sec is highly technical.</description></item><item><title>CyberApocalypse 2023 - A CTF Competition</title><link>https://www.maclaren.dev/posts/2023-03/capturing_some_flags/</link><pubDate>Thu, 23 Mar 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.maclaren.dev/posts/2023-03/capturing_some_flags/</guid><description>Another month, another CTF event HackTheBox runs a large, free, CTF event every year called CyberApocalypse. These events tend to have a theme, though it&amp;rsquo;s largely irrelevant to the actual challenges (or often their content), however it creates a fun little narrative to go along with it and sometimes gives contextual clues.
I participated again this year with a bit of a rag-tag crew from my work, and it was fun as usual.</description></item></channel></rss>
