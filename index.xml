The goal here is to find a way to retrieve the flag from the web server, using what appears to be a non-interactive webpage.
Captain Crunch hurts my mouth Since this is a whitebox challenge, we&amp;rsquo;re given the source code to review, and a local container that we can play with if so inclined.</description></item><item><title>Hack The Box - PetPetRcbee</title><link>https://maclarel.github.io/posts/2022-09/htb_petpetrcbee/</link><pubDate>Tue, 13 Sep 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://maclarel.github.io/posts/2022-09/htb_petpetrcbee/</guid><description>Premise PetPetRcbee is a Web challenge from Hack The Box that presents itself as a website which will take an image and animate it. Unlike many other challenges, you may be able to solve this one without ever actually looking at the site or seeing how it works&amp;hellip;
The setup This is a Flask application using Pillow and Ghostscript (9.23 - remember this) as the basis for its functionality. The overall source code is quite minimal, so review is easy.</description></item><item><title>Bell HomeHub 4000 + Ubiquiti Unifi Dream Machine VPN</title><link>https://maclarel.github.io/posts/2022-09/bell_udm/</link><pubDate>Sat, 10 Sep 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://maclarel.github.io/posts/2022-09/bell_udm/</guid><description>This article is a bit more to-the-point than most others I&amp;rsquo;ve written, and is mostly to serve as a reference point for others trying to configure a VPN server with Unifi products behind the Bell HomeHub 4000.
The HomeHub 4000 DMZ works&amp;hellip; kinda The HomeHub 4000 doesn&amp;rsquo;t have Bridge mode, period. This leaves users with three options:
Find a way to use PPPoE directly (possible, but janky) Use the &amp;ldquo;Advanced DMZ&amp;rdquo; feature on the HomeHub 4000 (Spoilers: It doesn&amp;rsquo;t work at all) Use the normal DMZ feature on the HomeHub 4000 and deal with double-NAT After several days of troubleshooting I opted for option 3 from the list above.</description></item><item><title>Karabiner is a game changer</title><link>https://maclarel.github.io/posts/2022-09/karabiner/</link><pubDate>Sun, 04 Sep 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://maclarel.github.io/posts/2022-09/karabiner/</guid><description>What is Karabiner and why? Karabiner Elements is an open source MacOS application that can be used to intercept and modify any keystroke, combination, etc&amp;hellip; on your machine and change it to do damn near anything you want. If you follow my blog or know me, you&amp;rsquo;ll know that I&amp;rsquo;m a big fan of custom keyboards and the flexibility that they allow by way of QMK or similar firmware - Karabiner recreates a lot of that functionality at the software level.</description></item><item><title>Hack The Box - RedPanda</title><link>https://maclarel.github.io/posts/2022-08/htb_redpanda/</link><pubDate>Tue, 30 Aug 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://maclarel.github.io/posts/2022-08/htb_redpanda/</guid><description>Premise RedPanda is a machine challenge that presents the attacker with a web app displaying cute pictures of Red Pandas. Adorable. The goal, as usual, is to find both user and root flags. This is done through a combination of SSTI and XXE, and admittedly is one of the most difficult challenges that I&amp;rsquo;ve completed so far&amp;hellip; despite being on the &amp;ldquo;easy&amp;rdquo; end of the spectrum.
Notes in this writeup will be a bit more freeform than others as I think sharing the overall approach I took may be of interest.</description></item><item><title>DEFCON 30 - Homecoming</title><link>https://maclarel.github.io/posts/2022-08/defcon30/</link><pubDate>Sat, 20 Aug 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://maclarel.github.io/posts/2022-08/defcon30/</guid><description>At last, DEFCON&amp;hellip; I&amp;rsquo;ve wanted to go to DEFCON since I first heard about it almost 20 years ago, and finally the stars aligned and it was a possibility this year. Spoilers, it didn&amp;rsquo;t disappoint.
While DEFCON is no longer the insane party that you may have heard of in the past, it&amp;rsquo;s none the less three-ish days of discovery and debauchery. Everything from super in-depth talks, to scavenger hunterse, to impromptu analog synth parties in the back end of the venue last at night after most folks have gone to bed.</description></item><item><title>Hack The Box - Phonebook</title><link>https://maclarel.github.io/posts/2022-08/htb_phonebook/</link><pubDate>Mon, 15 Aug 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://maclarel.github.io/posts/2022-08/htb_phonebook/</guid><description>Premise Phonebook is a Web challenge from Hack The Box that presents us with a login page for a &amp;ldquo;phonebook&amp;rdquo; system. The goal here is to find a flag hidden somewhere, however it&amp;rsquo;s considerably less obvious than it may seem.
Exploration When first navigating to the challenge URL you&amp;rsquo;l be greeted with a login prompt to access the phonebook. There don&amp;rsquo;t appear to be any useful links here, however there&amp;rsquo;s a note that the system now supports &amp;ldquo;workstation logins&amp;rdquo; and that post is signed by someone called &amp;ldquo;Reese&amp;rdquo;.</description></item><item><title>Management, burnout, and upcoming changes</title><link>https://maclarel.github.io/posts/2022-06/changes/</link><pubDate>Sun, 19 Jun 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://maclarel.github.io/posts/2022-06/changes/</guid><description>Management I got into management about a year ago, and it has been one hell of a ride. There&amp;rsquo;s sort of a running joke that &amp;ldquo;management isn&amp;rsquo;t for everyone&amp;rdquo;, and I can certainly verify that.
I had moved into management with the hopes of it being a great way to advance my career further, push me closer to the goal of getting a Director position, and hopefully scratching the same problem solving itch that solving technical problems and helping organize my team as a lead did.</description></item><item><title>Ploopy Classic &amp; Nano Trackballs</title><link>https://maclarel.github.io/posts/2022-06/ploopy/</link><pubDate>Sun, 19 Jun 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://maclarel.github.io/posts/2022-06/ploopy/</guid><description>That&amp;rsquo;s a silly name Yes.
What are they? Ploopy is a company that designs and produces open-source trackballs and mice.
Having been a Trackball enthusiast for a while, and not being able to find one that I really liked, I figured I&amp;rsquo;d give this a shot. One of my gripes in general has been that most of the trackballs out there are either great functionall but have shitty ergnomics, or have great ergonomics and awful functionality/drivers.</description></item><item><title>HackTheBox - Cyber Apocalypse 2022</title><link>https://maclarel.github.io/posts/2022-05/htb_cyber_apolcalypse/</link><pubDate>Tue, 24 May 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://maclarel.github.io/posts/2022-05/htb_cyber_apolcalypse/</guid><description>Well, that was harder than expected Many times in life it&amp;rsquo;s great to have a humbling experience. Not that I had an ego in this space anyway, I&amp;rsquo;m super new to it, but I was going in expecting to be able to crank through a fair number of challenges for this event. Let&amp;rsquo;s just say that didn&amp;rsquo;t happen.
Cyber Apocalypse 2022 was a jeopardy style CTF event with categories across all of the usual HackTheBox challenge content.</description></item></channel></rss>
