There&rsquo;s no timeline associated with the next steps!</p><p>This seems pretty minor, but let&rsquo;s flesh this scenario out a little bit, and let&rsquo;s say that I&rsquo;m the person asking for assistance. I&rsquo;ve clearly run into a problem and it&rsquo;s significant enough that I&rsquo;ve taken the time to send in a request for assistance because I can&rsquo;t progress on my work. It&rsquo;s wonderful that I&rsquo;ve reached someone willing to help, and that they understand the problem at a high enough level to paraphrase it, but now I&rsquo;m left with absolutely no understanding of when I&rsquo;ll hear back.</p><p>You may be reading this and think that the next steps are solely with the person troubleshooting the problem on the Support side, but you&rsquo;d be partially wrong. With no firm timeline established, the affected user who submitted the ticket also has to proactively reach out to Support if they need an update, since they don&rsquo;t know when they&rsquo;ll hear back. This makes for a poor customer experience since they&rsquo;re left wondering if they&rsquo;re going to hear back in an hour, a day, a week, or never.</p><p>All to often I&rsquo;ll see this scenario play out, even with industry veterans, and almost without fail the very next entry in the ticket (regardless of timeline) is from the customer saying &ldquo;Any updates?&rdquo;.</p><p>Let&rsquo;s do a small tweak, and outline the impact it has:</p><pre><code>Hi &lt;Name&gt;,

For example, is this actually blocking their whole team and not just them? Is there a business critical function that needs to happen by the end of the same day, meaning tomorrow is too late?</li><li>The ticket owner now has an obligation to address the issue on the timeline they&rsquo;ve specified, meaning they can better prioritize, instead of just throwing the issue into their (potentially large) backlog.</li></ul><h2 id=resetting-expectations>Resetting Expectations<a href=#resetting-expectations class=anchor aria-hidden=true><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M15 7h3a5 5 0 015 5 5 5 0 01-5 5h-3m-6 0H6a5 5 0 01-5-5 5 5 0 015-5h3"/><line x1="8" y1="12" x2="16" y2="12"/></svg></a></h2><p>In a perfect world, the severity of the problem in the example above was well communicated and ticket owner would provide a material update before the close of business the following day. Great, case closed (or at least notably progressed), but we all know that&rsquo;s not always what happens.</p><p>Let&rsquo;s talk about resetting expectations that were set.</p><p>Things change. The customer who submitted that example ticket isn&rsquo;t the only person having problems. Let&rsquo;s assume for a moment that the ticket owner got hit with a much more important problem - like another customer being completely down and blocked - and they haven&rsquo;t had time to address our example problem.</p><p>There are two likely scenarios, and outcomes, of this.</p><h3 id=scenario-1----the-ticket-does-not-receive-an-update-before-close-of-business-the-following-day>Scenario 1 - The ticket does not receive an update before close of business the following day<a href=#scenario-1----the-ticket-does-not-receive-an-update-before-close-of-business-the-following-day class=anchor aria-hidden=true><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M15 7h3a5 5 0 015 5 5 5 0 01-5 5h-3m-6 0H6a5 5 0 01-5-5 5 5 0 015-5h3"/><line x1="8" y1="12" x2="16" y2="12"/></svg></a></h3><p>This is the most common scenario I see from less experienced folks. Unfortunately, it tends to drive a far more negative outcome than you may expect at face value. Fortunately, it&rsquo;s a very easy problem to address!</p><p>Having dealt with customers as a front-line customer support person, an escalation point, a team lead, a main point-of-contact, and as a direct customer advocate, for almost 14 years I can quite comfortably tell you that the #1 cause of customer frustration is not receiving timely updates.</p><p>In this case, the customer is left without any information as to the status of their request and feels ignored. It&rsquo;s a safe bet that (assuming they haven&rsquo;t given up) that ticket owner is going to come in the next morning and see &ldquo;Any updates?&rdquo; front and center on that ticket. The customer won&rsquo;t be happy.</p><h3 id=scenario-2---the-ticket-is-updated-before-the-close-of-business-the-following-day-saying-that-theres-no-progress>Scenario 2 - The ticket is updated before the close of business the following day saying that there&rsquo;s no progress<a href=#scenario-2---the-ticket-is-updated-before-the-close-of-business-the-following-day-saying-that-theres-no-progress class=anchor aria-hidden=true><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M15 7h3a5 5 0 015 5 5 5 0 01-5 5h-3m-6 0H6a5 5 0 01-5-5 5 5 0 015-5h3"/><line x1="8" y1="12" x2="16" y2="12"/></svg></a></h3><p>Prior to the end of the following day, the ticket owner sends off this update:</p><pre><code>Hi &lt;Name&gt;,

This will let us reset expectations with the customer and keep the next steps entirely on the Support side (save for a possible escalation).</p><pre><code>Hi &lt;Name&gt;,

Overall length of time to (successfully) close a ticket is a distant second in terms of drivers for negative customer satisfaction behind a lack of communication.</p><p>While this scenario can be intimidating, I&rsquo;ll also not that you&rsquo;re significantly less likely to get directly negative feedback from a customer when providing a wrong answer, as long as it&rsquo;s done in a timely fashion and leaves the door open for them to follow-up with you.</p><h1 id=professional-written-communication>Professional Written Communication<a href=#professional-written-communication class=anchor aria-hidden=true><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M15 7h3a5 5 0 015 5 5 5 0 01-5 5h-3m-6 0H6a5 5 0 01-5-5 5 5 0 015-5h3"/><line x1="8" y1="12" x2="16" y2="12"/></svg></a></h1><p>I&rsquo;ll start out by noting that there&rsquo;s a difference between formal communication and professional communication. A lot of this will come down to the company that you&rsquo;re working with, and the &ldquo;voice&rdquo; that they are trying to present. For the sake of this section, we&rsquo;re not discussing formal writing as that&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s own skill in many cases.</p><p>To start out with, this is not intended to &ldquo;shame&rdquo; anyone who is not a native speaker of whatever language they are communicating in. English, in particular, is a disaster of a language and (in my opinion) it&rsquo;s reasonably ignorant to judge someone based on their grasp of a non-native language. If you fall into this bucket, I&rsquo;d strongly recommend the use of a Linter to help catch spelling and grammatical issues, such as linter-write-good for Atom.</p><p>With that out of the way, the high-level things we want to note here are:</p><ul><li>Organization of thoughts</li><li>Clear and concise wording</li><li>Proper punctuation, spelling, and grammar</li></ul><h2 id=organizing-your-thoughts>Organizing your Thoughts<a href=#organizing-your-thoughts class=anchor aria-hidden=true><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M15 7h3a5 5 0 015 5 5 5 0 01-5 5h-3m-6 0H6a5 5 0 01-5-5 5 5 0 015-5h3"/><line x1="8" y1="12" x2="16" y2="12"/></svg></a></h2><p>Issues can be complex, and responses can necessitate jumping between multiple logical scenarios. When you find yourself in this scenario, it can be very helpful to include things like headers (for example, the &ldquo;Organizing your Thoughts&rdquo; header here) to more clearly define context.</p><p>Similarly, it can be helpful to have a very high level summary, sometimes using bullet points or a numbered list, to specifically outline the information that will be further discussed&mldr; as we&rsquo;ve also done here.</p><p>Clear and Concise Wording</p><p>Time is valuable. If you can clearly, and politely, communicate a thought in two sentences instead of two paragraphs, do it. I&rsquo;ll provide examples of good, and bad, responses below.

You may want to consider loading values into a set for evaluation as this will likely perform much better. A set will allow you to only store the required values until a duplicate is found, which will likely result in significantly smaller memory utilization.

You bet.</p><p>As a &ldquo;fun&rdquo; exercise, try rewriting this in the comments below and see if you can clean it up!</p><h1 id=wrapping-up>Wrapping up<a href=#wrapping-up class=anchor aria-hidden=true><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M15 7h3a5 5 0 015 5 5 5 0 01-5 5h-3m-6 0H6a5 5 0 01-5-5 5 5 0 015-5h3"/><line x1="8" y1="12" x2="16" y2="12"/></svg></a></h1><p>I know that this all seems very basic, and it is, but it&rsquo;s the kind of thing where practice makes perfect. It&rsquo;s also very easy to get into bad habits like not proof-reading messages before sending or not providing enough information in responses. Experience certainly helps.</p><p>There are many other concepts we could discuss, and maybe they&rsquo;ll be done so in another post, but I&rsquo;ll leave you all with one final recommendation:</p><p>If you are providing someone with technical instructions, be sure to test the instructions first or specifically outline if they have not been tested. Nothing is worse than being on the receiving end of something that doesn&rsquo;t work at all when dealing with an &ldquo;expert&rdquo;. Mistakes certainly happen, but this one can generally be avoided pretty easily.</p></div><hr class=post-end><footer class=post-info><p><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="feather feather-tag meta-icon"><path d="M20.59 13.41l-7.17 7.17a2 2 0 01-2.83.0L2 12V2h10l8.59 8.59a2 2 0 010 2.82z"/><line x1="7" y1="7" x2="7" y2="7"/></svg><span class=tag><a href=https://www.maclaren.dev/tags/support>support</a></span><span class=tag><a href=https://www.maclaren.dev/tags/writing>writing</a></span><span class=tag><a href=https://www.maclaren.dev/tags/bestpractices>bestpractices</a></span></p><p><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="feather feather-file-text"><path d="M14 2H6A2 2 0 004 4v16a2 2 0 002 2h12a2 2 0 002-2V8z"/><polyline points="14 2 14 8 20 8"/><line x1="16" y1="13" x2="8" y2="13"/><line x1="16" y1="17" x2="8" y2="17"/><polyline points="10 9 9 9 8 9"/></svg>2158 Words</p><p><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="feather feather-calendar"><rect x="3" y="4" width="18" height="18" rx="2" ry="2"/><line x1="16" y1="2" x2="16" y2="6"/><line x1="8" y1="2" x2="8" y2="6"/><line x1="3" y1="10" x2="21" y2="10"/></svg>2020-04-12 00:00 +0000</p></footer></article><aside id=toc><div class=toc-title>Table of Contents</div><nav id=TableOfContents><ul><li><a href=#setting-expectations>Setting Expectations</a></li><li><a href=#resetting-expectations>Resetting Expectations</a><ul><li><a href=#scenario-1----the-ticket-does-not-receive-an-update-before-close-of-business-the-following-day>Scenario 1 - The ticket does not receive an update before close of business the following day</a></li><li><a href=#scenario-2---the-ticket-is-updated-before-the-close-of-business-the-following-day-saying-that-theres-no-progress>Scenario 2 - The ticket is updated before the close of business the following day saying that there&rsquo;s no progress</a></li><li><a href=#scenario-3---the-ticket-is-updated-and-expectations-are-reset>Scenario 3 - The ticket is updated, and expectations are reset</a></li></ul></li><li><a href=#further-breakdown>Further breakdown</a></li></ul><ul><li><a href=#organizing-your-thoughts>Organizing your Thoughts</a><ul><li><a href=#example-1>Example 1</a></li><li><a href=#example-2>Example 2</a></li></ul></li><li><a href=#punctuation-spelling-and-grammar>Punctuation, Spelling, and Grammar</a></li></ul></nav></aside><div class="post-nav thin"><a class=next-post href=https://www.maclaren.dev/posts/2020-04/home-lab-updates/><span class=post-nav-label><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="feather feather-arrow-left"><line x1="19" y1="12" x2="5" y2="12"/><polyline points="12 19 5 12 12 5"/></svg>&nbsp;Newer</span><br><span>Home lab updates</span></a>
