I know. I&rsquo;d prefer to have it on bare metal as well, however my main passtime outside of tinkering with technology is playing WoW Classic. At first you may think &ldquo;Ok, that definitely runs under Wine/Proton, right?&rdquo; and yes, it does, but Blizzard also has a long history of banning Linux gamers for perceived cheating, &ldquo;using an unsupported operating system&rdquo;, or any other number of non-sensical reasons.</p><p>In any case, that has kept me using Windows as the main OS installed on bare metal. Flip side, Virtual Box has come a long way and is exceptionally good for virtualizing a desktop OS - especially when compared to Hyper-V which I was using previously.</p><p>All that to say, I&rsquo;ve been working out of i3 on Arch all day despite it running in a VM and the only thing it has made me want to do is quit WoW so I can just use this without any additional overhead. It&rsquo;s wonderful.</p><h1 id=how-did-the-setup-go>How did the setup go?<a href=#how-did-the-setup-go class=anchor aria-hidden=true><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M15 7h3a5 5 0 015 5 5 5 0 01-5 5h-3m-6 0H6a5 5 0 01-5-5 5 5 0 015-5h3"/><line x1="8" y1="12" x2="16" y2="12"/></svg></a></h1><p>The Arch Wiki&rsquo;s installation guide is reasonably good, though like all things Arch it expects you to do a fair bit of research for yourself. If you haven&rsquo;t toyed around with Arch before, or at least don&rsquo;t have a very good understanding of how to do things like manually configure a network interface from scratch, I&rsquo;d suggest against doing this for your first time unless you&rsquo;re into learning-by-doing (like I am).</p><p>I&rsquo;ve dabbled with Gentoo in the past, and this is nowhere near that level of confusing to setup, but it&rsquo;s still not a pretty GUI like you&rsquo;ll get with Ubuntu or Pop, etc&mldr; That said, that didn&rsquo;t really factor into my decision.</p><p>I had a few hiccups during installation, mostly due to not quite understanding what I was getting &ldquo;for free&rdquo; with the installation vs what was running on the live disk I used for the installation. This meant that I had to spend a good 30-45 minutes figuring out all of the packages I needed to get my networking functional (I ended up using <code>networkd</code> for the sake of having it in line with my other boxen). Beyond that, though, was an infuriating 90 minute stretch of trying to get i3 to work&mldr;</p><p>i3 relies on <code>i3-config-wizard</code> to do the initial configuration file creation to actually be able to start i3, however <em>that wizard requires X to be running despite still being a text interface</em> which is beyond bizarre. It wasn&rsquo;t until I got xmonad running (and realizing that it wasn&rsquo;t for me) that I was able to actually get i3 configured and working. Haven&rsquo;t looked back since. After coming from a lot of tinkering with Amethyst, DisplayFusion, Yabai, and other &ldquo;window managers&rdquo; on Windows and MacOS, having something like i3 and it&rsquo;s integration with Xorg is&mldr; well, mindblowing. Full control over everything. It&rsquo;s perfect.</p><p>Without getting into the religious debates of what WM is the best, least bloated, etc&mldr; This is a fantastic example of the type of freedom you can get when you move away from Windows/MacOS and into an ecosystem that&rsquo;s literally built around user choice and flexibility. I&rsquo;ve never been one to enjoy playing within the rules, and now I truly don&rsquo;t have to.</p><h1 id=hows-it-going>How&rsquo;s it going?<a href=#hows-it-going class=anchor aria-hidden=true><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M15 7h3a5 5 0 015 5 5 5 0 01-5 5h-3m-6 0H6a5 5 0 01-5-5 5 5 0 015-5h3"/><line x1="8" y1="12" x2="16" y2="12"/></svg></a></h1><p>I&rsquo;ll do another post in a few weeks to recap using Arch + i3 as a daily driver for that period of time, but initial impressions are exclusively positive.</p><p>My experience of using Linux as a desktop OS in the past were mostly sullied by my own choices (Slackware as a daily driver? Eep!) or lack of knowledge at the time&mldr; but hey, that&rsquo;s how you learn. With the readily available knowledge between Wikis, colleages, friends, and Reddit it&rsquo;s now somewhat trivial to find answers to questions that would have taken weeks to sort out on IRC or forums (though I still enjoy both).</p><p>As an aside, the workspace approach here (and more importantly being able to trivially hotkey windows over to specific workspaces) is a game changer after coming from Windows/MacOS. I know that can all be done through various ways there as well, and I use those approaches, but it&rsquo;s <em>seamless</em> in i3 (and I&rsquo;m sure many other WMs). I love it.</p><p>Coming over from MacOS for work purposes, and Windows for personal projects, this is also a breath of fresh air. I&rsquo;ve got control over what&rsquo;s running, resource utilization is way down, and things are just much&mldr; snappier. Despite running this in a VM (and one that only has access to 1/3 my system resources) it is <em>vastly</em> more responsive than Windows 10 is on my beast or a PC, or MacOS on my max-spec 2019 MBP. It&rsquo;s really quite mind-boggling what I was living with, and how much better it could have been&mldr; despite running exactly the same applications!</p><p>The other thing that&rsquo;s of course beneficial here is that nearly all of my projects are based around stuff that just better works on Linux anyway. I don&rsquo;t need to deal with MacOS shipping with GNU Utils that are decades out of date, or the bizarre setup that is WSL (though WSL is still pretty cool!) - I&rsquo;ve got the latest and greatest at my fingertips, and nothing to get in the way of my work&mldr; only the things that I&rsquo;ve chosen to pull in to <em>support</em> my work. Is this&mldr; freedom?</p><h1 id=whats-next>What&rsquo;s next?<a href=#whats-next class=anchor aria-hidden=true><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M15 7h3a5 5 0 015 5 5 5 0 01-5 5h-3m-6 0H6a5 5 0 01-5-5 5 5 0 015-5h3"/><line x1="8" y1="12" x2="16" y2="12"/></svg></a></h1><p>Current things for me to tweak/understand:</p><ul><li>Can I get any GPU passthrough configured for this, and do I even need/want to?
