The problems in Python come when you need something that&rsquo;s x86 native&mldr; like trying to use <code>pwntools</code>. That&rsquo;s just a non-starter, so now I have to SSH out to another box to work on anything with that. Annoying.</li><li>Ruby&rsquo;s ecosystem though&mldr; just no. So many critical gems just don&rsquo;t have aarch64 support (yet?) which means I effectively can&rsquo;t do any validation locally. Again&mldr; I have to remote to something else to get work done.</li><li>Docker? Nah. Emulation with Docker Desktop on macOS flat out doesn&rsquo;t work. I can create images for other architectures&mldr; maybe&mldr; sometimes&mldr; but I can&rsquo;t run them. See above.</li><li>VMs? Nah. Non-native architecture emulation through UTM or VMWare Fusion is not a thing despite advertising. I did a drag race trying to set up a Win 10 (x86) VM between UTM (emulated x86) and a lower-spec personal machine. Both VMs had the same number of CPU cores, RAM, and access to local nvme storage. My x86 box had the install complete and booted in under 6 minutes. The UTM installation completed after about 53 minutes, and still had not successfully booted after another 40 minutes. See above again :\</li></ul><p>It&rsquo;s kind of ridiculous to have a laptop like this when the only features I actually use are the nice screen (if it isn&rsquo;t docked) and the battery life. I&rsquo;m grateful to have it, and for non-work purposes it&rsquo;s pretty great, but if you&rsquo;re looking at one of these for purposes <em>other</em> than purpose-built Apple stuff I&rsquo;d suggest looking at alternatives.</p><p>It&rsquo;s entirely likely that I&rsquo;m missing some solutions to these problems, but the frustration stands. I&rsquo;ve got a multi-thousand dollar machine that can&rsquo;t do simple tasks I require on a daily basis for work (and personal stuff).</p><h1 id=now-on-to-the-fun>Now on to the fun!<a href=#now-on-to-the-fun class=anchor aria-hidden=true><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M15 7h3a5 5 0 015 5 5 5 0 01-5 5h-3m-6 0H6a5 5 0 01-5-5 5 5 0 015-5h3"/><line x1="8" y1="12" x2="16" y2="12"/></svg></a></h1><p>I took part in another CTF competition this past month with the goal of helping test a new CTF platform for internal events. Single player teams, jeopardy style, 24 hour access. I came in 13th out of the roughly 65 players who completed any challenges, and > 110 signed up.</p><p>Honestly, it&rsquo;s not a result I&rsquo;m happy with.</p><p>Event categories included web, pwn, reversing, full pwn (machine), and forensics for a total of 15 challenges. I completed 5 of the 8 web challenges and 1 of the 2 forensics challenges.</p><p>I made extremely good headway on one of the two pwn challenges, but that&rsquo;s still an area well over my head. Plus side, I learned a lot about buffer overflows and ret2libc attacks. Still a total novice, though.</p><p>The frustrating thing for me is that I made such little progress in the full pwn/machine space as this is an area I tend to focus on in events. In this case I spent nearly 11 hours on a single challenge only to realize 15 minutes before the end of the event that the RCE vuln had been staring me in the face the entire time and I just hadn&rsquo;t realized what it was.</p><p>Lesson for others: If you see something and you don&rsquo;t know what it is, don&rsquo;t give up on your research easily. If it&rsquo;s insignificant, you&rsquo;ll probably still learn something. If it isn&rsquo;t, it might be what you need. In this case it was a string being surfaced (and then consumed) by the remote app that turned out to be <a href=https://docs.python.org/3/library/pickle.html>pickled data</a>. One small tweak to it and I would have had RCE. Boo.</p><p>Not that it matters in retrospect, but if I had caught that vulnerability earlier, I would have had a top 3 finish with just the points from that one challenge as only one person completed it.</p><p>The forensics challenge I finished was just deobfuscating Excel macros, which pointed me to a neat tool I hadn&rsquo;t seen before - <a href=https://github.com/DissectMalware/XLMMacroDeobfuscator>https://github.com/DissectMalware/XLMMacroDeobfuscator</a>. Worked like a charm, though for a simpler example.</p><p>Either way, another great learning experience. The next one for me will be nSec 2023 in Montreal. If you know a team looking for a mediocre hacker to join you&mldr; give me a shout!</p><h1 id=whats-coming-up-in-february>What&rsquo;s coming up in February?<a href=#whats-coming-up-in-february class=anchor aria-hidden=true><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M15 7h3a5 5 0 015 5 5 5 0 01-5 5h-3m-6 0H6a5 5 0 01-5-5 5 5 0 015-5h3"/><line x1="8" y1="12" x2="16" y2="12"/></svg></a></h1><p>Not a lot. Taking a little more time for myself in the coming month as part of the &ldquo;decompression and reprioritization&rdquo; I outlined in my last post.</p><p>I plan to continue poking at some challenges on HackTheBox as I work toward <code>Pro Hacker</code> rank (lol), and I have some work projects on the go that should be a lot of fun to talk about once they get a bit further on. Expect some fun articles about both of those :D</p><p>Beyond that&mldr; check out <a href=http://live.projectdiablo2.com/>Project Diablo 2</a> if you enjoyed Diablo 2 back in the day and wish there had been some evolution of it that took a different and more thorough direction than D2: Resurrected.
