In both cases these talks were focused on what I do for a living right now - helping to run a large Bug Bounty program at GitHub.</p><p>More interesting than the talks, personally, was just the added reason to attend these conferences. The quality and depth of content at NorthSec blew me away and I&rsquo;m really looking forward to attending in 2024 (and am trying to come up with a CFP submission&mldr;). DEFCON is always a blast, though the conference is certainly outgrowing itself - endless lines, but also endlessly interesting talks. I&rsquo;ve started to look at DEFCON more as an opportunity to meet up with friends and colleagues than as a purely educational experience since so much of the content is available online after and the real treasure is the friends we made along the way. Pro tip - if you&rsquo;re going to DEFCON and don&rsquo;t enjoy the chaos of casino hotels check out the Westin just off the strip (across from Bally&rsquo;s/Horseshoe).</p><h1 id=i-found-some-vulnerabilities-and-got-some-cves-credited-to-me>I found some vulnerabilities and got some CVEs credited to me<a href=#i-found-some-vulnerabilities-and-got-some-cves-credited-to-me class=anchor aria-hidden=true><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M15 7h3a5 5 0 015 5 5 5 0 01-5 5h-3m-6 0H6a5 5 0 01-5-5 5 5 0 015-5h3"/><line x1="8" y1="12" x2="16" y2="12"/></svg></a></h1><p>While these bugs were nothing too exciting, the learning that came with finding and exploiting them was an absolute blast. You can read about the findings, exploits, and remediation <a href=https://github.blog/2023-12-13-securing-our-home-labs-frigate-code-review/>in my post on GitHub&rsquo;s Security blog</a>.</p><p>More broadly this was an opportunity to formally collaborate and &ldquo;intern&rdquo; with GitHub&rsquo;s Security Lab team. While I&rsquo;m not sure security research is something I&rsquo;d want to do for a full time job, it was absolutely eye opening in terms of unknown unknowns for me and really reignited my desire to dig deeper into appsec in general.</p><p>Going into 2024 I&rsquo;m going to be focusing a lot more time in this space, moving a bit away from operational focus and more into the bug hunting/fixing side of the house.</p><h1 id=i-spent-a-lot-of-time-doing-ctfs>I spent a lot of time doing CTFs<a href=#i-spent-a-lot-of-time-doing-ctfs class=anchor aria-hidden=true><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M15 7h3a5 5 0 015 5 5 5 0 01-5 5h-3m-6 0H6a5 5 0 01-5-5 5 5 0 015-5h3"/><line x1="8" y1="12" x2="16" y2="12"/></svg></a></h1><p>Whether it was a casual day at NorthSec, a public event with HackTheBox, internal CTF events (shoutout in particular to the team at <a href=https://metactf.com/>MetaCTF</a>, or creating challenges for Ekoparty 2023 I really continue to enjoy this space.</p><p>Not only are CTF challenges a fun brain teaser, they really compound over time into what you could consider to be actual &ldquo;training&rdquo;. Bluntly, I&rsquo;ve learned more about webapp and Linux vulnerabilities and exploitation from CTFs than from years of actually working in the space.</p><p>There&rsquo;s no equivalent to being really hands-on finding these vulnerabilities and building exploits for them.

Full coverage everywhere in and around my house! I even have my garage wired up for LAN&mldr; I just need to find some other degenerates who are still interested in LAN parties.</p><p>The &ldquo;lab&rdquo; machine itself is still going strong, though it&rsquo;s really in need of an upgrade. 8 threads & 32GB of RAM is sufficient for any and all of the services I&rsquo;m running (and want to run), but limits are hit incredibly quickly when I start running VMs or poking at larger applications that I want to run either for personal usage or research purposes.</p><p>I think a proper server is in the books for 2024&mldr; 32 threads and 128GB of RAM perhaps? I&rsquo;m not interested in digging to deeply into hypervisor tech so it&rsquo;ll probably just be a single Proxmox node with a mix of NVMe & SATA SSD storage. I think the spinning rust can stay in the NAS. We&rsquo;ll see what the budget allows!</p><p>Beyond that, everything is still (loosely) managed with <a href=https://github.com/maclarel/ansible_playbooks>Ansible</a>, though part of the project planned above is to dig deeper (again) into Terraform/OpenTofu and other tech to make spinning up VMs on demand easier.</p><h1 id=thats-a-wrap>That&rsquo;s a wrap!<a href=#thats-a-wrap class=anchor aria-hidden=true><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M15 7h3a5 5 0 015 5 5 5 0 01-5 5h-3m-6 0H6a5 5 0 01-5-5 5 5 0 015-5h3"/><line x1="8" y1="12" x2="16" y2="12"/></svg></a></h1><p>2023 has been fun, but certainly not without its stress.
