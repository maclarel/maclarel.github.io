These events tend to have a theme, though it&amp;rsquo;s largely irrelevant to the actual challenges (or often their content), however it creates a fun little narrative to go along with it and sometimes gives contextual clues.
I participated again this year with a bit of a rag-tag crew from my work, and it was fun as usual.</description></item><item><title>January's woes</title><link>https://www.maclaren.dev/posts/2023-01/january_woes/</link><pubDate>Tue, 31 Jan 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.maclaren.dev/posts/2023-01/january_woes/</guid><description>It&amp;rsquo;s ~Morphin~ Bitchin time! I try to stay pretty positive with this blog, so I&amp;rsquo;ll keep this reasonably short.
The Apple Silicon Macs are amazing performance, battery life, power consumption, etc&amp;hellip; They&amp;rsquo;re also nearly worthless for my usecase as a developer and user of predominantly x86 applications.
Fortunately, most of the Python ecosystem seems to support aarch64 so much of my code works. The problems in Python come when you need something that&amp;rsquo;s x86 native&amp;hellip; like trying to use pwntools.</description></item><item><title>Contributing to a CTF event</title><link>https://www.maclaren.dev/posts/2022-11/make_a_ctf/</link><pubDate>Fri, 11 Nov 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.maclaren.dev/posts/2022-11/make_a_ctf/</guid><description>The project I recently had the opportunity to join a team building out some challenges for the Ekoparty CTF event, as my company has been a sponsor for a number of years. Given that I&amp;rsquo;ve been reasonably involved in playing CTFs as of late, as well as helping organize events within my company, I figured it might be fun to try building some challenges as well!
I worked with two colleagues to put together a series of 4 challenges:</description></item><item><title>TryHackMe - Root Me</title><link>https://www.maclaren.dev/posts/2022-10/thm_rootme/</link><pubDate>Mon, 03 Oct 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.maclaren.dev/posts/2022-10/thm_rootme/</guid><description>Premise RootMe is an introductory machine challenge on TryHackMe where the player is presented with a Linux machine they must get access to. This article is written to be more of a guide than a challenge writeup, with the goal of helping newer CTF players accustomed to some of the tools and techniques used for these kinds of challenges.
Throughout this walkthrough you&amp;rsquo;ll see reference to $target which is just me storing the IP address of the target machine in an environment variable for easier reference and reuse.</description></item><item><title>HackTheBox - Trick</title><link>https://www.maclaren.dev/posts/2022-09/htb_trick/</link><pubDate>Sun, 11 Sep 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.maclaren.dev/posts/2022-09/htb_trick/</guid><description>Premise Trick is machine challenge that presents itself initially as an incomplete website - from there we need to perform various types of enumeration, avoid rabbitholes, and use some classic vulnerabilities to get our flags!
Recon If we hit the challenge&amp;rsquo;s IP directly we get a totally non-functional website. There are initial references to a bootstrap form url (just https://startbootstrap/&amp;lt;stuff here&amp;gt;) however this will go nowhere - this is just poor documentation on the bootstrap side I think, as it should have .</description></item><item><title>Hack The Box - RedPanda</title><link>https://www.maclaren.dev/posts/2022-08/htb_redpanda/</link><pubDate>Tue, 30 Aug 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.maclaren.dev/posts/2022-08/htb_redpanda/</guid><description>Premise RedPanda is a machine challenge that presents the attacker with a web app displaying cute pictures of Red Pandas. Adorable. The goal, as usual, is to find both user and root flags. This is done through a combination of SSTI and XXE, and admittedly is one of the most difficult challenges that I&amp;rsquo;ve completed so far&amp;hellip; despite being on the &amp;ldquo;easy&amp;rdquo; end of the spectrum.
Notes in this writeup will be a bit more freeform than others as I think sharing the overall approach I took may be of interest.</description></item><item><title>HackTheBox - Cyber Apocalypse 2022</title><link>https://www.maclaren.dev/posts/2022-05/htb_cyber_apolcalypse/</link><pubDate>Tue, 24 May 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.maclaren.dev/posts/2022-05/htb_cyber_apolcalypse/</guid><description>Well, that was harder than expected Many times in life it&amp;rsquo;s great to have a humbling experience. Not that I had an ego in this space anyway, I&amp;rsquo;m super new to it, but I was going in expecting to be able to crank through a fair number of challenges for this event. Let&amp;rsquo;s just say that didn&amp;rsquo;t happen.
Cyber Apocalypse 2022 was a jeopardy style CTF event with categories across all of the usual HackTheBox challenge content.</description></item><item><title>Microsoft Strike CTF 2022 - Contoso Financial</title><link>https://www.maclaren.dev/posts/2022-04/msft_contoso_strike/</link><pubDate>Tue, 19 Apr 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.maclaren.dev/posts/2022-04/msft_contoso_strike/</guid><description>Premise Microsoft runs an internal CTF event every so often called Strike CTF. While we&amp;rsquo;ve been asked not to share specifics around the challenges involved, I wanted to do a brief write-up, as it&amp;rsquo;s certainly a unique one that catered to multiple skill levels and had an educational twist.
For anyone interested in doing some digging, the version Microsoft runs has also been seen in some B-Sides events (and other conferences) under the name ShadowBank.</description></item><item><title>Hack The Box - Pandora</title><link>https://www.maclaren.dev/posts/2022-04/htb_pandora/</link><pubDate>Mon, 04 Apr 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.maclaren.dev/posts/2022-04/htb_pandora/</guid><description>Premise Second verse same as the first - we&amp;rsquo;re given an IP and no further information. Commence enumeration!
Enumeration To set the stage, enumeration is probably the hardest part of this challenge. The rest is doable with some patience and research.
Out of the gate we have a website talking about some random product. There&amp;rsquo;s nothing interactable, and nmap only gives us TCP 22 and 80 as open ports.
Fuzzing with ffuf and nikto turns up nothing actionable, just icons and asset directories, neither of which can be used for anything.</description></item><item><title>Hack The Box - Paper</title><link>https://www.maclaren.dev/posts/2022-04/htb_paper/</link><pubDate>Fri, 01 Apr 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.maclaren.dev/posts/2022-04/htb_paper/</guid><description>Premise As with all Hack The Box (HTB) Machines we&amp;rsquo;re given nothing more than an IP.
Initial target enumeration with nmap shows us TCP 22, 80, and 443 open, with SSH and Apache 2.4.37 respectively. The TLS information returned isn&amp;rsquo;t super helpful, and hitting the website gives us nothing more than the default CentOS Apache httpd page.
Further exploration Next step, after a lot of poking, prodding, fuzzing, etc&amp;hellip; and getting nowhere was to try out nikto to see if there&amp;rsquo;s anything else the webserver might be leaking for us.</description></item></channel></rss>
