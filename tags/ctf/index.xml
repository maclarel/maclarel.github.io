This article is written to be more of a guide than a challenge writeup, with the goal of helping newer CTF players accustomed to some of the tools and techniques used for these kinds of challenges.
Throughout this walkthrough you&amp;rsquo;ll see reference to $target which is just me storing the IP address of the target machine in an environment variable for easier reference and reuse.</description></item><item><title>HackTheBox - Cyber Apocalypse 2022</title><link>https://www.maclaren.dev/posts/2022-05/htb_cyber_apolcalypse/</link><pubDate>Tue, 24 May 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.maclaren.dev/posts/2022-05/htb_cyber_apolcalypse/</guid><description>Well, that was harder than expected Many times in life it&amp;rsquo;s great to have a humbling experience. Not that I had an ego in this space anyway, I&amp;rsquo;m super new to it, but I was going in expecting to be able to crank through a fair number of challenges for this event. Let&amp;rsquo;s just say that didn&amp;rsquo;t happen.
Cyber Apocalypse 2022 was a jeopardy style CTF event with categories across all of the usual HackTheBox challenge content.</description></item><item><title>Microsoft Strike CTF 2022 - Contoso Financial</title><link>https://www.maclaren.dev/posts/2022-04/msft_contoso_strike/</link><pubDate>Tue, 19 Apr 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.maclaren.dev/posts/2022-04/msft_contoso_strike/</guid><description>Premise Microsoft runs an internal CTF event every so often called Strike CTF. While we&amp;rsquo;ve been asked not to share specifics around the challenges involved, I wanted to do a brief write-up, as it&amp;rsquo;s certainly a unique one that catered to multiple skill levels and had an educational twist.
For anyone interested in doing some digging, the version Microsoft runs has also been seen in some B-Sides events (and other conferences) under the name ShadowBank.</description></item><item><title>Hack The Box - Pandora</title><link>https://www.maclaren.dev/posts/2022-04/htb_pandora/</link><pubDate>Mon, 04 Apr 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.maclaren.dev/posts/2022-04/htb_pandora/</guid><description>Premise Second verse same as the first - we&amp;rsquo;re given an IP and no further information. Commence enumeration!
Enumeration To set the stage, enumeration is probably the hardest part of this challenge. The rest is doable with some patience and research.
Out of the gate we have a website talking about some random product. There&amp;rsquo;s nothing interactable, and nmap only gives us TCP 22 and 80 as open ports.
Fuzzing with ffuf and nikto turns up nothing actionable, just icons and asset directories, neither of which can be used for anything.</description></item><item><title>Hack The Box - Paper</title><link>https://www.maclaren.dev/posts/2022-04/htb_paper/</link><pubDate>Fri, 01 Apr 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.maclaren.dev/posts/2022-04/htb_paper/</guid><description>Premise As with all Hack The Box (HTB) Machines we&amp;rsquo;re given nothing more than an IP.
Initial target enumeration with nmap shows us TCP 22, 80, and 443 open, with SSH and Apache 2.4.37 respectively. The TLS information returned isn&amp;rsquo;t super helpful, and hitting the website gives us nothing more than the default CentOS Apache httpd page.
Further exploration Next step, after a lot of poking, prodding, fuzzing, etc&amp;hellip; and getting nowhere was to try out nikto to see if there&amp;rsquo;s anything else the webserver might be leaking for us.</description></item><item><title>picoCTF - notepad</title><link>https://www.maclaren.dev/posts/2022-03/pico_notepad/</link><pubDate>Sat, 26 Mar 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.maclaren.dev/posts/2022-03/pico_notepad/</guid><description>Premise We&amp;rsquo;re given a service that will take abitrary input, and render it as an HTML page.
There are a few restrictions:
Content cannot be longer than 512 characters Content cannot include _ or / characters Lastly, from the Dockerfile we know that the flag is going to have an arbtirary name starting with flag-.
Examining the tarball This challenge comes with a tarball that contains the source code so we can do some white box analysis of how all of this works.</description></item></channel></rss>
