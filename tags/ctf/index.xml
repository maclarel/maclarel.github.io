If you know, you know. If you don&amp;rsquo;t, then I guess you&amp;rsquo;ll have to come to the event in the future and find out!

I wish the NorthSec conference wasn&amp;rsquo;t only two days The amount of outstanding content, workshops, and side quests that NorthSec offers is just too much for only two days.</description></item><item><title>2023 in Review - DEFCON, CVEs, and Life</title><link>https://www.maclaren.dev/posts/2023-12/2023/</link><pubDate>Tue, 19 Dec 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.maclaren.dev/posts/2023-12/2023/</guid><description>What is time, anyway? 2023 is at an end, and my posts to this blog have been few and far between this year. Fortunately, this isn&amp;rsquo;t a reflection of having a lack of things to do but perhaps the opposite. Please enjoy this highlight reel of &amp;ldquo;fun&amp;rdquo; things that 2023 has brought&amp;hellip;
I spoke at a few conferences One of my personal goals this year was to submit to a few CFPs (Call for Papers) for various security-related conferences after getting back into public speaking in some capacity with BSides Ottawa in 2022.</description></item><item><title>NorthSec 2023 - A LAN party for hackers</title><link>https://www.maclaren.dev/posts/2023-05/nsec2023/</link><pubDate>Sat, 20 May 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.maclaren.dev/posts/2023-05/nsec2023/</guid><description>What is NorthSec? NorthSec is a security conference in Montreal, QC, Canada that has been running since 2013. In addition to fantastic technical talks, awesome badges, and free beer (yes, really), they have one of the largest in-person CTF events on earth.
This year&amp;rsquo;s event saw ~1,500 attendees for the conference/talks, and 700+ for the in-person CTF event.
Somewhat unique, at least in my conference experience, much of the content in the talks at North Sec is highly technical.</description></item><item><title>CyberApocalypse 2023 - A CTF Competition</title><link>https://www.maclaren.dev/posts/2023-03/capturing_some_flags/</link><pubDate>Thu, 23 Mar 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.maclaren.dev/posts/2023-03/capturing_some_flags/</guid><description>Another month, another CTF event HackTheBox runs a large, free, CTF event every year called CyberApocalypse. These events tend to have a theme, though it&amp;rsquo;s largely irrelevant to the actual challenges (or often their content), however it creates a fun little narrative to go along with it and sometimes gives contextual clues.
I participated again this year with a bit of a rag-tag crew from my work, and it was fun as usual.</description></item><item><title>January's woes</title><link>https://www.maclaren.dev/posts/2023-01/january_woes/</link><pubDate>Tue, 31 Jan 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.maclaren.dev/posts/2023-01/january_woes/</guid><description>It&amp;rsquo;s ~Morphin~ Bitchin time! I try to stay pretty positive with this blog, so I&amp;rsquo;ll keep this reasonably short.
The Apple Silicon Macs are amazing performance, battery life, power consumption, etc&amp;hellip; They&amp;rsquo;re also nearly worthless for my usecase as a developer and user of predominantly x86 applications.
Fortunately, most of the Python ecosystem seems to support aarch64 so much of my code works. The problems in Python come when you need something that&amp;rsquo;s x86 native&amp;hellip; like trying to use pwntools.</description></item><item><title>Contributing to a CTF event</title><link>https://www.maclaren.dev/posts/2022-11/make_a_ctf/</link><pubDate>Fri, 11 Nov 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.maclaren.dev/posts/2022-11/make_a_ctf/</guid><description>The project I recently had the opportunity to join a team building out some challenges for the Ekoparty CTF event, as my company has been a sponsor for a number of years. Given that I&amp;rsquo;ve been reasonably involved in playing CTFs as of late, as well as helping organize events within my company, I figured it might be fun to try building some challenges as well!
I worked with two colleagues to put together a series of 4 challenges:</description></item><item><title>TryHackMe - Root Me</title><link>https://www.maclaren.dev/posts/2022-10/thm_rootme/</link><pubDate>Mon, 03 Oct 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.maclaren.dev/posts/2022-10/thm_rootme/</guid><description>Premise RootMe is an introductory machine challenge on TryHackMe where the player is presented with a Linux machine they must get access to. This article is written to be more of a guide than a challenge writeup, with the goal of helping newer CTF players accustomed to some of the tools and techniques used for these kinds of challenges.
Throughout this walkthrough you&amp;rsquo;ll see reference to $target which is just me storing the IP address of the target machine in an environment variable for easier reference and reuse.</description></item><item><title>HackTheBox - Trick</title><link>https://www.maclaren.dev/posts/2022-09/htb_trick/</link><pubDate>Sun, 11 Sep 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.maclaren.dev/posts/2022-09/htb_trick/</guid><description>Premise Trick is machine challenge that presents itself initially as an incomplete website - from there we need to perform various types of enumeration, avoid rabbitholes, and use some classic vulnerabilities to get our flags!
Recon If we hit the challenge&amp;rsquo;s IP directly we get a totally non-functional website. There are initial references to a bootstrap form url (just https://startbootstrap/&amp;lt;stuff here&amp;gt;) however this will go nowhere - this is just poor documentation on the bootstrap side I think, as it should have .</description></item><item><title>Hack The Box - RedPanda</title><link>https://www.maclaren.dev/posts/2022-08/htb_redpanda/</link><pubDate>Tue, 30 Aug 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.maclaren.dev/posts/2022-08/htb_redpanda/</guid><description>Premise RedPanda is a machine challenge that presents the attacker with a web app displaying cute pictures of Red Pandas. Adorable. The goal, as usual, is to find both user and root flags. This is done through a combination of SSTI and XXE, and admittedly is one of the most difficult challenges that I&amp;rsquo;ve completed so far&amp;hellip; despite being on the &amp;ldquo;easy&amp;rdquo; end of the spectrum.
Notes in this writeup will be a bit more freeform than others as I think sharing the overall approach I took may be of interest.</description></item><item><title>HackTheBox - Cyber Apocalypse 2022</title><link>https://www.maclaren.dev/posts/2022-05/htb_cyber_apolcalypse/</link><pubDate>Tue, 24 May 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.maclaren.dev/posts/2022-05/htb_cyber_apolcalypse/</guid><description>Well, that was harder than expected Many times in life it&amp;rsquo;s great to have a humbling experience. Not that I had an ego in this space anyway, I&amp;rsquo;m super new to it, but I was going in expecting to be able to crank through a fair number of challenges for this event. Let&amp;rsquo;s just say that didn&amp;rsquo;t happen.
Cyber Apocalypse 2022 was a jeopardy style CTF event with categories across all of the usual HackTheBox challenge content.</description></item></channel></rss>
