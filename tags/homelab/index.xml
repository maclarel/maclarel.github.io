What has changed? Server rebuild New (2nd hand) 24 port gigabit switch 900W UPS Synology DS918 NAS So what am I doing with all these toys? The server rebuild is probably one of the bigger things here. While I was already hosting VMs and Docker containers on this box when it was running Windows, it was unreliable at best thanks to forced updates/reboots in Windows 10.</description></item><item><title>Server Rebuild</title><link>https://maclaren.dev/posts/2021-05/server_rebuild/</link><pubDate>Sun, 16 May 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://maclaren.dev/posts/2021-05/server_rebuild/</guid><description>What did I do? Half fueled by beer, and half by a playlist of keygen tracks, I decided that it would be a good idea to finally getting around to rebuilding my long-lived server&amp;hellip; No more Windows and its infuriating forced updates (which you used to be able to override), lack of clear/consistent OS level event scripting for integration with my UPS, or garbage-tier support from Docker. I wanted something that I&amp;rsquo;d finally have the level of control I wanted for something that backs pretty much eveverything I use outside of work.</description></item><item><title>Home lab updates</title><link>https://maclaren.dev/posts/2020-04/home-lab-updates/</link><pubDate>Wed, 22 Apr 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://maclaren.dev/posts/2020-04/home-lab-updates/</guid><description>Following up from my &amp;ldquo;Starting out with a home lab&amp;rdquo; article I&amp;rsquo;ve made some pretty nice updates to my home lab setup, and I&amp;rsquo;ve also got my {Ansible playbooks](https://github.com/maclarel/ansible_playbooks) up on GitHub now!
Starting out with the lab additions:
Gigabit internet (Cable, unfortunately) recently became available here, so I&amp;rsquo;ve now got a 1000/30 connection! Upload speeds are depressing, but still 3x the speed I had previously! UniFi Dream Machine has taken over my network.</description></item><item><title>Starting out with a home lab</title><link>https://maclaren.dev/posts/2020-04/starting-out-with-a-home-lab/</link><pubDate>Sat, 04 Apr 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://maclaren.dev/posts/2020-04/starting-out-with-a-home-lab/</guid><description>Why do I want a home lab? While only you, the reader, can answer this, there are many reasons that I&amp;rsquo;ve build one out. I imagine your reasoning will be similar.
There are things you want to have, or automate, that are simply obnoxious otherwise. You&amp;rsquo;ve got specific technologies that you want to explore without a full scale investment. You&amp;rsquo;re working toward certifications (or hands-on experience) with technologies that you want to be using for work.</description></item></channel></rss>
