CVE-2024-29191 CVE-2024-29192 CVE-2024-29193 CVE-2024-31991 CVE-2024-31992 CVE-2024-31993 CVE-2024-31994 The first three of these are related to go2rtc and are follow-ups from the earlier investigation done with Frigate. These were found in collaboration with Jorge Rosillo from GitHub Security Lab, and I recommend taking a read through the advisory article for details on these.</description></item></channel></rss>
