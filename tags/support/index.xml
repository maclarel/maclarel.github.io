The premise of his article was effectively that in many companies Support is often seen as entry level, with no possible advancement in the organization outside of management. While his proposal discusses laddering up to &amp;ldquo;Senior&amp;rdquo; positions, I find that this may be aiming too low when looking at deeply technical support work like with many &amp;ldquo;enterprise&amp;rdquo; products.</description></item><item><title>Relentless follow-through in Support</title><link>https://www.maclaren.dev/posts/2021-11/expectations/</link><pubDate>Mon, 08 Nov 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.maclaren.dev/posts/2021-11/expectations/</guid><description>Way back in April 2020 I wrote an article called Written communication for support which covered some high level best practices around setting, managing, and resetting expectations. Think of this as a spiritual successor to that article, as we&amp;rsquo;re going to talk about the other side of the coin - relentless follow-through.
To put &amp;ldquo;relentless follow-through&amp;rdquo; in more direct terms, I want to discuss some best practices around timeliness of responses even when there&amp;rsquo;s no news, internal follow-up and expectation setting, and some options for collaboration (depending on the size/maturity of your business).</description></item><item><title>Written communication for Support</title><link>https://www.maclaren.dev/posts/2020-04/written-communication-for-support/</link><pubDate>Sun, 12 Apr 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.maclaren.dev/posts/2020-04/written-communication-for-support/</guid><description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been working in customer facing roles for quite a while now. Granted, these have largely had the luxury of being in software companies, but I&amp;rsquo;ve also done a brief retail stint and I&amp;rsquo;d like to think the same skills apply in all cases.
While this will be by no means exhaustive, I want to go over two high-level concepts that I feel are extremely important, and can sometimes be overlooked even by veterans in customer facing positions.</description></item></channel></rss>
