What are they? Ploopy is a company that designs and produces open-source trackballs and mice.
Having been a Trackball enthusiast for a while, and not being able to find one that I really liked, I figured I&amp;rsquo;d give this a shot. One of my gripes in general has been that most of the trackballs out there are either great functionall but have shitty ergnomics, or have great ergonomics and awful functionality/drivers.</description></item></channel></rss>
