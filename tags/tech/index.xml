The HomeHub 4000 DMZ works&amp;hellip; kinda The HomeHub 4000 doesn&amp;rsquo;t have Bridge mode, period. This leaves users with three options:
Find a way to use PPPoE directly (possible, but janky) Use the &amp;ldquo;Advanced DMZ&amp;rdquo; feature on the HomeHub 4000 (Spoilers: It doesn&amp;rsquo;t work at all) Use the normal DMZ feature on the HomeHub 4000 and deal with double-NAT After several days of troubleshooting I opted for option 3 from the list above.</description></item><item><title>Karabiner is a game changer</title><link>https://www.maclaren.dev/posts/2022-09/karabiner/</link><pubDate>Sun, 04 Sep 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.maclaren.dev/posts/2022-09/karabiner/</guid><description>What is Karabiner and why? Karabiner Elements is an open source MacOS application that can be used to intercept and modify any keystroke, combination, etc&amp;hellip; on your machine and change it to do damn near anything you want. If you follow my blog or know me, you&amp;rsquo;ll know that I&amp;rsquo;m a big fan of custom keyboards and the flexibility that they allow by way of QMK or similar firmware - Karabiner recreates a lot of that functionality at the software level.</description></item><item><title>Ploopy Classic &amp; Nano Trackballs</title><link>https://www.maclaren.dev/posts/2022-06/ploopy/</link><pubDate>Sun, 19 Jun 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.maclaren.dev/posts/2022-06/ploopy/</guid><description>That&amp;rsquo;s a silly name Yes.
What are they? Ploopy is a company that designs and produces open-source trackballs and mice.
Having been a Trackball enthusiast for a while, and not being able to find one that I really liked, I figured I&amp;rsquo;d give this a shot. One of my gripes in general has been that most of the trackballs out there are either great functionall but have shitty ergnomics, or have great ergonomics and awful functionality/drivers.</description></item></channel></rss>
